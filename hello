SpaceShooter is a simple 2D arcade-style shooter 
                        built entirely with Java Swing. You control a rocket 
                        ship and defend yourself against waves of incoming enemies. 
                        The goal is to survive as long as possible by shooting enemies 
                        before they collide with your ship.

                        The game features smooth player controls and pixel-style enemy sprites 
                        that move dynamically across the screen. With basic collision detection 
                        and a fixed 700Ã—700 window, SpaceShooter delivers a fun and retro coding 
                        experience focused on game logic, object-oriented design, and event-driven 
                        programming in Java.

An upgraded version of the classic 
                            Tic Tac Toe game built in Java, 
                            featuring a fully optimized computer 
                            opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.
                            This version replaces random computer moves 
                            with a decision-making AI that can evaluate 
                            future outcomes and always play the best possible 
                            move. The project focuses on algorithmic thinking, 
                            recursion, and game logic, offering a practical 
                            demonstration of how artificial intelligence can 
                            make strategic decisions.
